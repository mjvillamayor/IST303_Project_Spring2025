## Initial User Stories
*Patients*
1. As a patient, I want to be able to find links to additional information for potential side effects of prescribed medication so that I can know what to expect from its consumption. (Estimate: 1 day)
2. As a patient, I want to access my own individual medical history, alongside my personal history of previously prescribed medication disbursements, so that I am aware of my own current and preexisting conditions. (Estimate: 3 days)
3. As a patient, I want a messaging system that allows me to communicate with healthcare staff so that I can easily reach out to them for medical advice and guidance whenever necessary. (Estimate: 4 days)
4. As a patient, I want to receive dashboard alerts for missed medication and potential prescription renewals so that I can be proactive about my own health and medications. (Estimate: 2 days)
5. As a patient, I want to be sure all medications administered are verified through barcode scanning so that I know that I am receiving the correct treatment. (Estimate: 5 days)
6. As a patient, I want to log in to my own portal that features demographic characteristics of myself for a holistic profile, along with a dashboard of logging symptoms and displaying any diagnoses, so that there is transparency about myself and my health. (Estimate: 5 days)

*Medical Providers*
1. As a medical provider, I want links to information of potentially dangerous interactions between medications taken at the same time so that patients' health are not unknowingly endangered by such. (Estimate: 1 day)
2. As a medical provider, I want the system to automatically check for potential drug interactions at the point of prescribing, so that I can ensure the safety of my patients by avoiding harmful combinations. (Estimate: 3 days)
3. As a medical provider, I want to receive and send alerts for missed medication disbursements of given patients so that patients' prescribed medication treatments are not interrupted. (Estimate: 2 days)
4. As a medical provider, I want to be able to log in to my own portal with various functions including a messaging system between doctors and nurses for patient healthcare so that the most optimal care is prioritized. (Estimate: 7 days)
5. As a medical provider, I want to access notes from other healthcare personnel, so that no information is lost between personnel when changing shifts. (Estimate: 2 days)
6. As a medical provider, I want to access the database of patients' medical histories so that I can be aware of any current and preexisting conditions whenever necessary. (Estimate: 3 days)

*Administrators*
1. As an administrator, I want to implement 2FA into the system via email verification links after typing in a username and password, so that the security and integrity of the application are ensured. (Estimate: 3 days)
2. As an administrator, I want the system to automatically notify me when medication stock levels are low, so that I can reorder supplies before they run out. (Estimate: 4 days)
3. As an administrator, I want to make sure all administered medications are verified through barcode scanning so that patients are ensured to receive the correct treatment. (Estimate: 4 days)
4. As an administrator, I want to be able to receive compliance reports from medical providers and other administrators for auditing and internal purposes on a quarterly basis, so as to ensure the healthcare facility is regularly meeting regulation and safety standards. (Estimate: 5 days)
5. As an administrator, I want to assign various functional roles to different types of administrators on the application so that workloads and permissions are subdivided across roles. (Estimate: 3 days)
6. As an administrator, I want to implement a feedback system that allows all stakeholders to voice improvements and concerns so that the application can be dynamically improved. (Estimate: 3 days)
